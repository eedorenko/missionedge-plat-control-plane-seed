# Introduction

This is the BigBang control plane seed to get started with deploying applications leveraging the [Coral](https://github.com/microsoft/coral) platform.

## Getting Started

To get started, see the [platform setup instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/platform-setup.md) in the main Coral repo.

## Overview

- `.github/workflows` - Runs a workflow on each push to transform Coral entities into cluster gitops repo YAML to be processed by Flux
- `applications`
  - `<workspace-name>`
    - `ApplicationRegistrations` - defines the `ApplicationRegistrations` for a given workspace ([sample](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/samples/ApplicationRegistration.yaml))
    - `ManifestDeployments` - defines the `ManifestDeployments` (dialtone services) for a given workspace
- `assignments` - holds the application:cluster assignments after Coral processes the repo
- `clusters` - defines the `Clusters` in your platform ([sample](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/samples/Cluster.yaml))
- `manifests` - holds Kubernetes YAML for use with `ManifestDeployments`
- `templates` - defines the available `ApplicationTemplates` in your platform ([sample](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/samples/ApplicationTemplate.yaml))
- `workspaces` - defines the `Workspaces` in your platform ([sample](https://github.com/microsoft/coral/blob/main/docs/samples/Workspace.yaml))
